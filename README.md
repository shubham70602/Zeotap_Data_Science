### README for eCommerce Transactions Analysis Assignment

#### **Overview**
This project involves analyzing an eCommerce transactions dataset to extract meaningful insights, develop a customer lookalike model, and perform customer segmentation. The goal is to demonstrate expertise in exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive modeling, and clustering techniques while delivering actionable business insights.

---

#### **Dataset Details**
The project uses three files:  
1. **Customers.csv**  
   - `CustomerID`: Unique identifier for customers.  
   - `CustomerName`: Name of the customer.  
   - `Region`: Continent where the customer resides.  
   - `SignupDate`: Date of customer signup.

2. **Products.csv**  
   - `ProductID`: Unique identifier for products.  
   - `ProductName`: Name of the product.  
   - `Category`: Product category.  
   - `Price`: Product price (USD).  

3. **Transactions.csv**  
   - `TransactionID`: Unique identifier for transactions.  
   - `CustomerID`: Associated customer.  
   - `ProductID`: Associated product.  
   - `TransactionDate`: Date of the transaction.  
   - `Quantity`: Quantity purchased.  
   - `TotalValue`: Transaction total value.  
   - `Price`: Product price in the transaction.

#### **Tasks and Deliverables**

**1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Clean and merge datasets to create a unified view.
- Visualize key metrics like revenue trends, regional contributions, and product performance.
- Derive actionable insights for marketing, inventory management, and customer engagement.
- Deliverables:
  - Jupyter Notebook with EDA code and visualizations.
  - PDF report with business insights.

**2. Lookalike Model**
- Build a machine learning model to recommend 3 similar customers based on profile and transaction history.
- Use customer and product data to calculate similarity scores.
- Deliverables:
  - Lookalike.csv containing similarity scores for the first 20 customers.
  - Jupyter Notebook explaining model development and results.

**3. Customer Segmentation**
- Perform clustering using customer profile and transaction data.
- Evaluate clusters using metrics such as DB Index.
- Visualize clusters and provide actionable recommendations for targeting each segment.
- Deliverables:
  - Jupyter Notebook with clustering analysis and visualizations.
  - Report including the number of clusters, DB Index value, and other metrics.
